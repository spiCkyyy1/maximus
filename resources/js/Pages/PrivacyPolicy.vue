							<h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Our Commitment to Privacy</h4>
							<p class="font-md">
								Maximus, Inc. (together with its affiliates, "Maximus") respects your privacy and we have developed the following statement to demonstrate our commitment to you. This privacy statement applies to personal information we collect about you on the Maximus website located at maximus.com (the “Site”) and describes the types of information collected, how that information is used, and the choices users have about collection and use of this information. This privacy statement does not govern privacy practices associated with offline activities, websites other than this Site, or products and services not available or enabled via this Site, except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Statement. Effective January 1, 2020.
							</p>
							<h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Information We Collect</h4>
							<p class="font-md">
								Although much of the Site is available without registration or providing personal information, in order to take advantage of some of our Site’s features, you will be asked to provide personal information. This personal information is provided voluntarily by you, the user, in order to participate or register for a particular product or service, or when you otherwise communicate with us or the Site.

							<p class="font-md">
								We clearly identify data you must provide so we can deliver the services or information you request. Maximus may ask that you provide personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP/Postal code), country of residence, email address, telephone numbers and other personal information. Providing this information is optional, but failure to do so in some cases will limit the services available to you.
								In addition, our web servers automatically collect and log web usage data from you when you visit the Site. This information, including your Internet Protocol (IP)
								address, referring sites, pages viewed, browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit web pages, and length of visit, informs us about how visitors use and navigate the Site.

								You may be asked to provide additional information not contained in your application to assist the recruitment and selection processes (for example, references or for vetting and/or security checks). If you choose not to provide the requested information, it may limit our ability to assess your suitability for employment and we may be unable to proceed with your application.

							<h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Cookies and Google Analytics</h4>
							<p>
								Like most websites, we employ "cookies," "Web beacons," and similar devices to help you more efficiently use the Site and to track your activities. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables Maximus to record your activities and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. A Web beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or e-mail used to track when the page or e-mail has been viewed. Maximus uses cookies and similar devices to track your use of the Site, types of Products and Services viewed and information downloaded, count visitors we receive daily. Our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer. Maximus does not generally use this information to identify you personally. 
								Our website uses Google Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to Google Analytics servers in the United States. Google Analytics does not identify individual users or associate your IP address with any other data held by Google Analytics. We use reports provided by Google Analytics to help us understand website traffic and webpage usage.

							<h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Opt-Out of Cookies and Google Analytics</h4>
