<h2 id="-a-name-question-a-got-a-question-or-problem-"><a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?</h2>
<p>Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You&#39;ve got much better chances of getting your question answered on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ag-grid">StackOverflow</a> where the questions should be tagged with tag <code>ag-grid</code>,
or on our <a href="https://ag-grid.com/forum">Forum</a></p>
<p>If you&#39;re using the Enterprise version of ag-Grid (ag-grid-enterprise), then the <a href="https://ag-grid.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=5">Members Forum</a> is the best place to ask - you&#39;ll get a much quicker response there. Please contact <a href="mailto:accounts@ag-grid.com">accounts@ag-grid.com</a> for access.</p>
<p>To save your and our time we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support (for ag-Grid Free) and redirecting people to StackOverflow.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-issue-a-found-a-bug-"><a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?</h2>
<p>If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
<a href="#submit-issue">submitting an issue</a> to our <a href="https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-feature-a-missing-a-feature-"><a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?</h2>
<p>You can <em>request</em> a new feature by <a href="#submit-issue">submitting an issue</a> to our GitHub
Repository.</p>

<h3 id="-a-name-submit-issue-a-submitting-an-issue"><a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue</h3>
<p>Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.</p>
<p>We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using <a href="http://plnkr.co">http://plnkr.co</a>. Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back &amp; forth to you with additional questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>version of ag-Grid used</li>
<li>3rd-party libraries and their versions</li>
<li>and most importantly - a use-case that fails</li>
</ul>
<p>A minimal reproduce scenario using <a href="http://plnkr.co/">http://plnkr.co/</a> allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem. If plunker is not a suitable way to demonstrate the problem (for example for issues related to our npm packaging), please create a standalone git repository demonstrating the problem.</p>
<p>We will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal plunk. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.</p>
<p>You can file new issues by filling out our <a href="https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/new">new issue form</a>.</p>
<p>PR&#39;s on new features <strong>are not</strong> generally accepted.</p>
<p>PR&#39;s on small bug fixes <strong>are</strong> generally accepted.</p>
